# Privacy Policy for Oliver

Effective date: February 18, 2026
Last updated: February 18, 2026

Oliver is a product of **Kuip Limited, Ireland** ("Kuip", "we", "us", "our").

This Privacy Policy explains how Oliver handles information when you use the mobile app.

## 1) Short version

- We are designed to process your media mostly on your device.
- We do not run a backend service that receives your photos, videos, audio, sensor-chain data, or local blockchain records by default.
- If you choose Google sign-in and Google Drive backup, selected proof files are uploaded to your Google Drive account.
- Some data may be sent to third-party providers you directly use in the app (for example Google Drive or map tiles).

## 2) Information Oliver processes

### a) Media and proof data (on device)

Oliver may process:

- Photos, videos, audio files you capture or import
- Derived hashes and chain records
- Proof package files (for example `.oliver`)
- C2PA-related metadata you enter (creator, organization, website, email)

By default, this information is stored locally on your device.

### b) Sensor and location data (on device)

If you enable capture features, Oliver may process:

- GPS location
- Device sensor values (such as compass and accelerometer)
- Timestamps related to capture events

This data is used to generate integrity/provenance records in the app.

### c) Google account and Google Drive (optional, opt-in)

If you choose to sign in with Google:

- We request Google OAuth access for `drive.file` and email.
- Your Google email address and OAuth credentials/tokens are stored locally on your device.
- Oliver may upload proof files to your Google Drive when you use backup/upload features.

We do not receive your Google password.

### d) Device security authentication

If your device supports local authentication, Oliver may request biometric/PIN/passcode authentication to unlock app access.
Biometric data is handled by the device OS and is not collected by Kuip.

### e) Web and map features

If you use in-app web or map features, network requests are made directly to third-party services (for example websites you open, OpenStreetMap tile servers, Google services when signed in).

## 3) Permissions used

Oliver may request:

- `CAMERA` for photo/video capture
- `RECORD_AUDIO` for audio capture
- Location permissions for GPS-linked capture data
- Storage/file access permissions to import/export media and proofs
- Biometric/device-auth permissions to protect app access

You can control app permissions in your device settings.

## 4) How we use information

We use processed information to:

- Capture/import media
- Build and verify integrity/provenance chains
- Generate and manage proof packages
- Optionally upload proofs to your Google Drive
- Provide app security and settings functionality

We do not sell personal information.

## 5) Data sharing

We share data only as needed to provide features you choose, including:

- Google APIs/Google Drive (if you sign in and upload)
- Third-party endpoints you access directly (for example websites and map tile providers)

## 6) Data retention and deletion

- Local app data remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- You can delete media/proof files and app data from your device.
- If you uploaded files to Google Drive, delete them from your Drive to remove them there.

## 7) Children

Oliver is not directed to children under 13 (or higher minimum age where required by local law).

## 8) International data transfers

If you use third-party services (for example Google Drive), your data may be processed in other countries under those providers' policies.

## 9) Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new "Last updated" date.
